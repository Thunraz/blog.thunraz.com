Today, me and my girlfriend brewed some beer.
Since we have never done that before she gave me a [IPA beer brewing kit](http://www.koksbryggeriet.se/)
as a gift for my birthday. Along to the basic ingredients the kit contains the tools like a 5L fermenter,
a thermometer, a plug with an airlock and a siphon to facilitate the bottling process.

The basic brewing process is fairly simple:

1. **Sanitize** You don't want any germs in your beer, so clean your tools first.
2. **Mash** Mix the malt with water at certain temperature to dissolve the malt starch in the water.
3. **Sparge** Use a strainer to separate the malt from the water. This kit makes use of spraymalt which is added here.
4. **Boil** Boil the wort and add hops.
5. **Cool** Cool down as quickly as possible.
6. **Fermentation** Fill the wort into the fermenter and place it in a dark, cool place for two weeks.
7. **Bottling** Use the siphon to easily fill the bottles, put some sugar in it for carbonation and seal it with a cap.
    After two more weeks, the beer is ready to drink.

This is our wort during the boil phase. In the background you can see a copper spiral I made to cool down the wort faster.
