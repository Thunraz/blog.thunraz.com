title: Building a road bike
---

I already own a mountain bike (a 2016 Specialized Stumpjumper FSR Comp 29) but I wanted another bike
to travel longer distances with. Also I've always liked building stuff myself instead of just buying the finished product,
so I decided to build my own road bike. I found a cheap used aluminum frame on eBay classifieds in almost pristine condition
(even though the frame is over eight years old).

*By now I've bought a carbon fork (actually two because I ruined the first one), a headset, stem and the handlebars*

*I've also painted the fork in a matte black because I didn't like the glossy carbon look. The first fork comes in handy for a before/after*

Next up is the groupset.
