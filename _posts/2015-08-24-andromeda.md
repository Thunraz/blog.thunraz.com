A better view of the [Andromeda Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy).
Stacked from eight pictures with an exposure time of five minutes each.

You can see some distortion towards the borders of the image. This is called
[coma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_(optics)). I have yet to buy a correcting lens for that.
